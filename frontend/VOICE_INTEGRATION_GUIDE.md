## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Audio Recording**

```typescript
// Uses MediaRecorder API for real-time audio capture
const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true });
mediaRecorderRef.current = new MediaRecorder(stream);
```

### **Voice Processing Pipeline**

1. **Record Audio** → User speaks into microphone
2. **Send to Backend** → Audio file sent to `/voice/complete` endpoint
3. **Transcribe** → Backend uses Whisper for speech-to-text
4. **Process Query** → Text goes through RAG pipeline
5. **Generate Response** → AI creates answer in selected language
6. **Convert to Speech** → Backend converts response to audio
7. **Play Response** → Frontend plays audio response

### **Error Handling**

- Microphone access errors
- Audio recording failures
- Network connectivity issues
- Backend processing errors
- Audio playback problems

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Start your backend server:**

   ```bash
   cd ingres-rag-api
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Start your frontend:**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test voice features:**
   - Open http://localhost:5173
   - Click the microphone button
   - Speak a groundwater-related question
   - Listen to the AI response

## 🎵 Audio Quality Tips

- **Speak clearly** and at normal volume
- **Use a quiet environment** for better recognition
- **Speak in English** for best speech recognition accuracy
- **Keep questions concise** for better processing

## 🔒 Browser Permissions

The voice features require:

- **Microphone access** - For recording voice input
- **Audio playback** - For playing AI responses

Modern browsers will prompt for these permissions on first use.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Microphone Not Working**

- Check browser permissions
- Ensure microphone is not being used by other applications
- Try refreshing the page

### **Audio Not Playing**

- Check browser audio settings
- Ensure speakers/headphones are connected
- Try clicking the speaker button manually

### **Poor Recognition**

- Speak more clearly
- Reduce background noise
- Use shorter, simpler questions

## 🎉 You're All Set!
